# Gravel Game

---
- Gravel Game is a brain-stimulating activity where you have to think twice before doing a move!
- You have a 4x4 board in front of you with 16 pieces of Gravel on it, on every cell.
- But who really cares about this? No one, that's who. So let's get straight to the point, you win if you can't take any more Gravel from the board.
- Now we know how to win, so it's easy to determine the loser! The loser is the one who takes the last Gravel off from the board!
- Now we know everything, except the rules. Do we need to know them though? Of course we do!
- The way you are able to take Gravels from the board is very simple and here it is:
  
  - you are only able to take a Gravel or at the very most four of them
  - and also you can take multiple Gravels only if they are in the same row or in the same column as the first Gravel that you have taken off.
  - It's important to mention that, you cannot take multiple Gravels off the same row or column if they have a space in between them where you or your enemy already took off a Gravel.
- Enough of the rules, go and see them for yourself, that's how you will learn!
- Hope you enjoy It! Have a great game!
